# leaflash

Development CLI for the [LeafKVM](https://www.crowdsupply.com/leafkvm/leafkvm) device.

```text
leaflash flash -i image.img             # SD card; in-place A/B-aware refresh
leaflash tui                             # interactive
leaflash usb <subcommand>                # nested rockusb-cli
```

Every subcommand also has short aliases: `f`/`sd`, `ub`/`spi`, `t`, `us`.

## Subcommands

### `flash` (alias `f`, `sd`) — write to the SD card

Manages an A/B layout: `rootfs_a`, `rootfs_b`, `userdata`. The common
case is an in-place refresh that **does not touch the partition table
or userdata**:

```sh
leaflash flash -i image.img       # writes to whichever slot the GPT marks bootable
leaflash flash -i image.img -p rootfs_b   # write to the other slot
leaflash flash -i image.img -p both       # write to both slots
leaflash flash -i image.img -r            # also reset the device after flash
```

Defaults that the on-disk GPT supplies when omitted:

- `-p, --partition` — the slot with the legacy-BIOS-bootable bit.
- `-s, --rootfs-size` — size of one rootfs slot, read from the GPT.

The first time you flash a card (or any time the layout changes) you need
explicit values **and** `--allow-partition`, since rewriting the GPT
destroys userdata:

```sh
leaflash flash -i image.img -s 256MiB -p rootfs_a --allow-partition
```

Other flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-d, --device <bus>:<address>` | pick a specific RockUSB device when several are attached |
| `-r, --reset-after-flash` | reboot the device when the flash finishes |
| `-m, --userdata-magic` | write `LEAFKVMUSERDATAMAGIC` at the start and end of userdata so the bootloader auto-wipes it on next boot (rather than prompting) |
| `-p, --partition <rootfs_a\|rootfs_b\|both>` | target slot(s) |
| `--allow-partition` | required guard for any flash that rewrites the GPT |

### `tui` (alias `t`) — interactive TUI

Multi-device aware (`r` refreshes, `1`-`9` selects when more than one
RockUSB device is attached). After picking an image and rootfs size,
press the Flash button to open a confirmation dialog that lists the
target slot, both partition sizes, the SD capacity, and an estimate of
userdata. The chosen slot renders as `rootfs_X (active)` in green when
it matches the slot the on-disk GPT marks bootable, so you can
immediately tell whether the flash is an in-place refresh or a slot
switch.

Keys (top-level): `Tab` cycles focus, `q`/`Esc`/`Ctrl-C` quits,
`r` refreshes devices, `1`-`9` selects a device, `b` toggles
reboot-after-flash, `m` toggles userdata-magic, `p` toggles target
partition (`A → B → Both → A`).

### `usb` (alias `rk`) — low-level rockusb

Nested verbatim from
[`rockusb-cli`](https://github.com/wtdcode/rockchiprs/tree/dev/rockusb-cli):
`list`, `download-boot`, `read`/`write` LBAs, `switch-storage`,
`reset-device`, …  Useful for one-off operations (recovery, exploring
flash state) when the higher-level subcommands aren't a fit.

## Build

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The `Release` GitHub workflow cross-compiles on every `v*` tag and
publishes raw binaries for Linux (musl), macOS, and Windows on both
amd64 and aarch64 — `leaflash-linux-amd64`, `leaflash-linux-aarch64`,
`leaflash-macos-amd64`, `leaflash-macos-aarch64`,
`leaflash-win-amd64.exe`, `leaflash-win-aarch64.exe`. One curl, no
extract:

```sh
curl -L -o leaflash https://github.com/Leafkvm/leaflash/releases/latest/download/leaflash-linux-amd64
chmod +x leaflash
```
